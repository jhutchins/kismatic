## kismatic seed-registry

seed a registry with the container images required by KET

### Synopsis


Seed a registry with the container images required by KET during the installation
or upgrade of your Kubernetes cluster.

The docker command line client must be installed on this machine to be able 
to push the images to the registry.

The location of the registry is obtained from the plan file by default. If you
don't have a plan file, you can pass the location of the registry using the 
--server flag. The server specified through the flag takes precedence over the 
one defined in the plan file.

If you want to further control how your registry is seeded, or if you are only
interested in the list of all images that can be used in a KET installation, you
may use the --list-only flag.
