## kismatic server

server starts an HTTP server

### Synopsis


Start an HTTP server to manage KET clusters. The API has endpoints to create, mutate, delete and view clusters.

A local datastore will be created to persist the state of the clusters managed by this server.

If cert-file or key-file are not provided, a self-signed CA will be used to create the required key-pair for TLS.
