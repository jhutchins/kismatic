## kismatic upgrade

Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis

Upgrade your Kubernetes cluster.

The upgrade process is applied to each node, one node at a time. If a private docker registry
is being used, the new container images will be pushed by Kismatic before starting to upgrade
nodes.

Nodes in the cluster are upgraded in the following order:

1. Etcd nodes
2. Master nodes
3. Worker nodes (regardless of specialization)


```

```
      --dry-run            simulate the upgrade, but don't actually upgrade the cluster
  -h, --help               help for upgrade
  -o, --output string      installation output format (options "simple"|"raw") (default "simple")
      --partial-ok         allow the upgrade of ready nodes, and skip nodes that have been deemed unready for upgrade
